_Note: My GitHub Contribution Grid became less green after June 2024 as my organization assigned me a separate [GitHub Enterprise Managed User account](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-iam/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-enterprise-managed-users) to perform my job duties.

I am a present and engaged teammate who thrives on trust, brings high agency to work, and finds learning opportunities in every experience. The following is a recap of my current professional experience:

8+ years of experience building and shipping full-stack web applications that balance security, user experience, and accessibility, leading cross-functional projects with a bias for action, and growing teams through mentorship and support. Proficient with frontend development using JavaScript/Typescript frameworks (React, Next.js), advanced state management patterns (state machines, Zustand, Redux), and backend development with API design (Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB).

I am committed to continuous professional development. I am currently advancing my backend skills by learning Go, Kotlin, and PostgreSQL while also refining my mobile development skills by using Expo/React Native on side projects. I've been working on an mobile app to learn Mandarin using geolocation data.
